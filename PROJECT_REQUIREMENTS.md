# Project Requirements

## Core Technical Requirements
1. **Node.js/Express.js/MongoDB application**
   - Must use Node.js and Express
   - No PHP code accepted
   - Must use routes (express.Router()) for some endpoints
   - Must store and retrieve data from MongoDB

2. **User Input**
   - At least one form where users provide data

3. **CSS Requirements**
   - Define and use a CSS file that:
     - Uses background-color, color, and font-size properties
     - Uses at least one Google font

4. **External API Integration**
   - Must rely on at least one API that provides external data (weather, pictures, etc.)
   - Resources suggestions:

     - https://developer.vonage.com/blog/2021/03/15/the-ultimate-list-of-fun-apis-for-your-next-coding-project
     - https://apipheny.io/free-api/
     - https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
   - Using setInterval, setTimeout, fetch by themselves (without downloading data from somewhere online) does not satisfy the API requirement

5. **Deployment**
   - Application must be deployed online (e.g., using a service like https://render.com/)

## Grading Breakdown
- (45%) Use of Node.js/Express/express.Router()
- (14%) Application stores and retrieves data from MongoDB
- (8%) Application relies on at least one form
